            <p>
            In this text, I write about a set of ideas which concern the role of entropy production in 
            driving the emergence of complexity and organization in certain natural systems, most notably 
            biological. I then touch on some theoretical efforts to apply this thermodynamic framework 
            to the development and functioning of much larger scale systems, such as the biosphere and 
            the technoshpere. Finally, I speculate about how such ideas could inform a view where technological 
            systems are envisaged to be more closely aligned, in their construction and operation, with the 
            energetic and organizational properties of life.

            <p>
            Originating from nineteenth century physics, the concept of entropy—a measure of disorder, 
            randomness, or the dissipation of useful energy—shaped a cosmology in which order and 
            complexity were considered improbable in a universe tending toward chaos and 
            disorganization. Nearly a century later, new theoretical frameworks were developed which viewed 
            entropy production as deeply intertwined with self-organized complexity in the natural 
            world. These ideas helped to establish connections between the origins, development, 
            and evolution of life and the thermodynamic principles governing the universe. For some, they also 
            supplied the conceptual foundations for theorizing a natural and universal tendency driving 
            the progressive emergence of increasingly complex and ordered systems, whose activities, in turn, 
            amplify the rate of entropic energy dispersal in the cosmos. In this paper I chart a path through the 
            aforementioned ideas and explore their significance in framing a relationship between our 
            technological civilization and the Earth system. I then speculate about the prospect of a 
            technosphere whose constitution and activity align with thermodynamic principles of 
            dissipation and entropy production, drawing on theoretical biology and recent advances 
            in bioengineering to envision a future paradigm where technology becomes a form of living matter.

            <p class="subtitle">Biology in the Context of Cosmological Entropy</p>
            <p>
            The concept of entropy originates from nineteenth century thermodynamics and is meant to describe a  
            measure  of  disorder,  randomness,  and/or  the  dissipation  of  useful  energy  in  a  system.  
            It’s  often  associated with the general idea that natural processes tend to move toward more 
            disorderly states over time. A few simple examples will serve to illustrate this concept. Consider 
            a drop of ink inside a glass of water. Initially, the molecules which make up the ink are 
            concentrated in a small area. However, as time passes, they disperse and spread throughout the 
            molecules of water, leading to a more disordered and random distribution. Eventually, the molecules 
            will become uniformly distributed within the glass, mixing completely with the water and reaching a 
            highly entropic state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Another example is observed when you place a 
            warm object, such as a cup of hot tea, inside a room with a lower temperature. Over time, the 
            temperature differential between the cup and the room will become equalized as heat, or thermal 
            energy, from the tea transfers to the surrounding molecules in the air of the room. Similar to the 
            dissipation of ink in water, the temperature of the tea and the room together will eventually reach 
            an equilibrium where the entropy of the whole system has increased, and heat has been evenly 
            distributed over the total space. 
            </p>
            <img class="txtimg" src="entropy1.jpeg">
            <p>
               The latter example of heat flow in a system was precisely what physicist and mechanical engineer Sadi Carnot 
               discovered through his analysis of the efficiency of steam engines <a href="#e">[1]</a>: i.e. that heat always 
               moves down a gradient from hotter to colder states. This basic insight would later become the basis for the 
               second law of thermodynamics. The transformation of thermal energy into mechanical energy—as in the case of 
               a temperature differential powering a steam engine—also, perhaps unsurprisingly, involves the dissipation of 
               energy into the environment in the form of heat, becoming spread out into the surroundings and 
               therefore incapable of performing work once more.
            </p>
            <p>
               In the mid 1800s, Carnot’s idea would be refined by Lord Kelvin (William Thomson) and Rudolf Clausius, 
               <a href="#e">[2]</a> two seminal physicists who were instrumental in unifying the emerging field and providing 
               formal clarity and rigour to the notion of entropy as well as the first two laws of thermodynamics. Together, 
               these two laws describe a universal tendency toward the dissipation of mechanical energy in a cosmos where the 
               total amount of energy is fixed and conserved, while entropy refers to a measure of the energy in a system which 
               is no longer available for work. Physicist Ludwig Boltzmann supplemented these ideas with a statistical 
               interpretation of the second law which defined the tendency for orderly components of a system—particularly 
               molecules in a box—to spread out toward more probable arrangements, or dispersed and disorderly configurations, 
               until they approach a state of elevated entropy and thermodynamic equilibrium. It follows, therefore, that the 
               spontaneous generation of orderly configurations from disordered states was considered by Boltzmann to be infinitely 
               improbable. <a href="#e">[3]</a> These ideas played a significant role in shaping a cosmological model where living systems were 
               understood to be anomalous, improbable, and contingent accidents in a universe running down toward a “heat death”, 
               <a href="#e">[4]</a> with all its parts drifting toward increased disorder and degradation. <a href="#e">[5]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               However, unlike purely physical, non-living processes, biological systems seem to strike a peculiar balance between 
               the second law of thermodynamics and the ability to generate, maintain, and propagate complexity and order. This kind 
               of activity appears at odds with the above description of the nature of physical reality: if the state of the 
               universe is thought to be lurching toward an increase in cosmic disorder—as the second law of thermodynamics is 
               often interpreted—why then do we observe an abundance and increasing development of structure, order, organization, 
               and complexity within our planet’s biosphere? 
            </p>
            <p>
               During the last century, the notion of living systems as thermodynamically open systems operating in far from equilibrium 
               conditions has emerged as a compelling theoretical framework to clarify this enigmatic property of biology and reconcile it with 
               the laws of thermodynamics. <a href="#e">[6]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               In this view, living systems engage in a dynamic interplay with their environment, selectively exchanging matter and 
               energy with their surroundings in order to generate the work required to produce and maintain a self-organized state 
               of organic individuation and local entropy minimization. Put plainly, biological systems transform external resources 
               into internal order. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The process of localized entropy reduction embodied by self-organized living systems is non-contradictory with 
               respect to the physical laws it seems to evade, since the flows of matter and energy underpinning organic form 
               necessitate the exogenous displacement of entropy from the living process in the form of waste and heat. This 
               consequently produces a global net increase of entropy within the surroundings of a given biological system. 
               In his pioneering work, <i>What Is Life?</i> physicist Erwin Schrödinger offered one of the earliest articulations of this 
               general idea. In Schrödinger’s words, what a biological system “feeds upon is negative entropy. Or, to put it less 
               paradoxically, the essential thing in metabolism is that the organism succeeds in freeing itself from all the entropy 
               it cannot help producing while alive.” <a href="#e">[7]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               In Schrödinger’s writing, these intuitions about the generation and stabilization of order in living systems aren't
               supported by much empirical knowledge and are expressed primarily through statistical equations and speculations about 
               the organism “feeding” upon “negative entropy” or “sucking orderliness from its environment.” <a href="#e">[8]</a> 
               Schrödinger would ultimately connect these ideas to the unique molecular arrangement of “aperiodic solids” 
               with hereditary properties, a hypothesis which would later inform geneticists in their understanding of the 
               structure of DNA and the role this was thought to play in supplying informational content for organismal form and
               function. However, subsequent work by researchers in biochemistry, 
               biophysics, theoretical biology, complexity science, and other related areas, would also build upon Schrödinger’s 
               impressions to flesh out a more robust theory of the relationship between non-equilibrium thermodynamics, 
               self-organization, metabolism, and the complexity and order found in biological systems.

               In the following section, I turn to some of this work to provide an overview of the entangled and dialectic nature 
               of entropy and dynamic order, self-organized complexity, and life. In doing so, I will highlight a spectrum of 
               self-organizing processes by drawing a path from non-living dissipative systems to the far-from-equilibrium 
               thermodynamics of life and its activity.

            <p class="subtitle">Dissipative Systems: From Self-Organization to Autopoiesis</p>
            <p>
               Physical chemist Ilya Prigogine’s work on complex dissipative systems is arguably one of the most significant 
               contributions to the line of thought connecting thermodynamic principles with the generation of natural order. 
               In a nutshell, dissipative systems—a term coined by Prigogine and his colleagues in a number of publications 
               during the late 1960s and first introduced at a conference on theoretical physics and biology <a href="#e">[9]</a>—
               are complex dynamic structures operating far from conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. These open systems tend 
               to spontaneously self-organize into spatiotemporally ordered processes whose metastable steady states are reproduced 
               by exchanging energy and matter with their environments. Such systems can be both naturally occurring, like 
               whirlpools, flames, tornados, or Jupiter’s Giant Red Spot, as well as artificially generated, as in the case 
               of Bénard cells. <a href="#e">[10]</a> In a recent paper on the topic of Schrödinger’s <i>What Is Life?</i> lectures, 
               theoretical biologist Stuart Kauffman discusses the illustrative example of Bénard cells in some detail: 
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
               “…there is a pan with a shallow layer of viscous liquid … heated slowly from below, creating a temperature gradient, 
               hotter on the bottom than top of the fluid. The temperature gradient induces an overall heat flow to the environment 
               … When the temperature gradient surpasses the Rayleigh threshold, convective cells arise and dissipate heat more 
               effectively. The convective cells are the Bénard cells … [whose] patterns are sustained by the continuous flow of 
               energy through the system that results by heating the pan from below.” <a href="#e">[11]</a> 
            </p>
            <img class="txtimg" src="benard1.jpeg">
            <p>
               Much like Bénard cells, cyclones such as tornados or hurricanes, and other similarly structured natural phenomena 
               like whirlpools or turbulent flow, maintain the emergent macroscopic patterns which constitute their dynamical form 
               through the incessant flux of their components—i.e. via the constant flow of energy and matter through the system 
               supplied by an energy gradient. In other words, the dynamic regularities, or structural identity, of a dissipative system 
               emerges and develops through a
               continuous and directed flow of energy and matter which is resultantly dispersed more effectively into 
               the surroundings as entropy.
            </p>
            <p>
               We can see here the beginnings of a theory of natural phenomena which describes the tendency for order to emerge 
               from the enabling conditions of a thermodynamic universe. From this perspective, the relationship between 
               entropy and order is dialectically entangled such that the production of entropy acts as a natural, 
               generative condition for the emergence of structure, organization, and complexity, and not simply disorder 
               and equilibrium. In other words, entropy functions as a progenitor of dynamic order for a certain class of 
               physical systems which leverage or exploit, so to speak, the same thermodynamic principles which lead to 
               disorganization and decay in other contexts. The spontaneous development of complexity and organization is 
               therefore equally as natural as the propensity for chaos and disorder in a universe whose activity conforms 
               with thermodynamic laws. <a href="#e">[12]</a>  
            </p>
            <p>
               This theoretical framing is thought to provide a basis for understanding certain primordial and 
               fundamental properties of 
               biological systems, as well. For instance, biophysicist Jeremy England has suggested that non-equilibrium physical 
               systems tend to vary in their structure over time in a manner which correlates with their ability to optimally 
               absorb and dissipate energy from their environment. England bridges physics and biology by connecting this 
               historical and quasi-adaptive property with the evolutionary dynamics of living systems, 
               <a href="#e">[13]</a> proposing maximal entropy production as a common principle driving the activity and 
               morphology of self-organizing physical systems, as well as minimal molecular systems and more complex biology. 
               Kauffman has also offered a related narrative in his work on self-organization and complexity, building on 
               various frameworks in the complexity sciences to study the relationship between laws of spontaneous order and 
               self-organization and questions regarding the origin and evolution of life. <a href="#e">[14]</a> 
               For Kauffman, the universe supplies 
               order for free as a result of deeply natural laws shaping the behaviour of non-equilibrium systems. 
               In this view, living systems are seen as expressions of the coupling of spontaneous, 
               self-organizing complexity and the dynamics of evolutionary selection. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Similarly, environmental scientist Eric Schneider and theorist Dorion Sagan have maintained that the tendency for 
               non-equilibrium systems to optimize for dissipation, via their exploitation of various energy gradients, is 
               fundamental to all complex biological structures and processes—from the origin of life to evolution and 
               ecology. <a href="#e">[15]</a> The authors elevate this tendency to the status of a natural principle, arguing that 
               biological systems are enabled by the same physics of energy flow operating in non-living dissipative systems: 
               “[non-equilibrium thermodynamics] connects life to nonliving complex systems … life’s complexity is a natural 
               outgrowth of the thermodynamic gradient reduction implicit in the second law.” <a href="#e">[16]</a> Echoing this 
               sentiment in an earlier publication, biochemist Jeffrey Wicken has also linked thermodynamics with the historical 
               and ecological development of molecular and organismal complexity. Wicken argues that “life’s emergence was not at all 
               accidental” but arose quite naturally from “the free energy gradients (solar and geothermal) of prebiotic Earth”, 
               producing entropy at elevated rates by discharging these gradients, and others, during the history of life's 
               continued evolutionary diversification.

            <p>
               We might also turn to Prigogine once again to explore a related set of ideas. One crucial theoretical development to 
               emerge from Prigogine and his collaborators’ work on dissipative systems was the Brusselator, a theoretical model 
               for an autocatalytic system. <a href="#e">[18]</a> Autocatalysis—or a process whereby one or more reaction products 
               act as a catalyst for the same reaction—can be seen as a minimal requirement for defining living systems and their 
               common metabolic and/or replicative properties. <a href="#e">[19]</a> These kinds of looping reaction cycles are 
               thought to be vitally important for describing self-organizing, far-from-equilibrium structures as well 
               as certain regulatory mechanisms underpinning metabolic functioning and specific organizational processes unique 
               to biological systems. <a href="#e">[20]</a> Others have expressed comparable ideas through the lens of their own 
               work, notably Kauffman’s theory of autocatalytic sets and neuro-anthropologist Terrence Deacon’s model of 
               the autogen. With the latter, a synergetic loop between multiple thermodynamic self-organizing processes generates 
               the conditions for the maintenance and replication of a self-enclosed system and its autocatalytic components.  
               <a href="#e">[21]</a> A similar logic informs the idea of autocatalytic sets, whereby the general metabolic activity 
               and self-replicating behaviour which underlie all organismic activity is posited as a typical outcome of the dynamic 
               stability of autocatalytic networks. <a href="#e">[22]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               A handful of thinkers have also touched more specifically on the structural and organizational relationship between 
               the thermodynamic properties of open systems and the continuous flow of energy and matter which sustains the 
               self-organizing, self-maintaining, and self-producing behaviours of minimal biological systems. An early and 
               highly influential contribution can be found in the research of neurobiologists Humberto Maturana and 
               Francisco Varela. Maturana and Varela's work on the concept of “autopoiesis” highlights not only the closed recursiveness of a self-producing 
               network of molecular relations (much like autocatalytic sets) but the necessary and enabling condition of such a 
               system to remain open to flows of matter and energy through it. <a href="#e">[23]</a> That is to say, a 
               fundamental property of biological organization is its continuous realization through the process of incessant 
               material turnover. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Continuing in this tradition, theoretical biologists Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Mossio assert the need to ground this 
               unique property of biology in thermodynamics, qualifying living systems as “dissipative systems dealing in a 
               constitutive way with a thermodynamic flow that traverses them.” <a href="#e">[24]</a> This perspective is also 
               reflected in a recent compilation of essays titled <i>Everything Flows</i>, edited by philosophers and historians of 
               biology John Dupré and Daniel Nicholson. In their introduction, Dupré and Nicholson write of the organism's 
               existential condition of needing to be continuously thermodynamically active in order to exist. 
               <a href="#e">[25]</a>  Biological systems must metabolize matter from their surroundings to acquire and dissipate 
               energy, rebuild and replenish cells, and maintain their identity in a steady state. In other words, an 
               organism's stability derives from a continuous circulation of its components, driven by the non-equilibrium 
               dynamics of dissipating energy from its environment. Much like the Bénard cell, the maintenance of organized 
               and ordered living states, or dynamic biological stability, requires a continuous movement of energy passing 
               through an open system.

            <p>
               Philosopher Rod Swenson has explored related ideas in his work on the thermodynamics of self-organization, 
               ecology, and evolution. In his research, Swenson expounds upon a notion of autocatakinesis, or “identity through 
               flow” <a href="#e">[26]</a>, whereby both living systems and self-organizing physical systems 
               maintain their dynamically ordered spatio-temporal coherence through a circular causal regime realized by 
               far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions. Swenson draws on the likes of Prigogine and Schrödinger, as well 
               as philosophers and scientists such as Heraclitus, Gottfried Wilhelm Liebniz, and Ludwig Von Bertalanffy, to 
               stress the connection between dissipative systems and living beings, both of which are open non-equilibrium 
               systems whose structural and organizational identity is constituted by continuous coordination of its parts via 
               the relentless flow and degradation of energy and matter from their respective environments. <a href="#e">[27]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               It’s important to pause briefly at this juncture to highlight an important distinction between living beings and 
               non-living, strictly physical, dissipative systems, despite the continuity presented here between the thermodynamic 
               properties of the latter and the origins, behaviour, and evolution of life. While biological systems are 
               energetically open systems—operating in far-from-equilibrium conditions maintained by a constant throughput of 
               energy and matter—they’re also characterized by their ability to realize closure. <a href="#e">[28]</a> Closure refers to the 
               collective activity and mutual dependence of various interrelated constraints which constitute bounded 
               individuation, organizational complexity, and functional differentiation in living systems. <a href="#e">[29]</a> 
               This notion is closely related to the concept of autopoiesis: i.e., a system constituted by the 
               interdependence between an internal reaction network and a boundary, each of which continuously supplies 
               the necessary conditions for the other’s regeneration and enables the system to emerge as a topological 
               unity distinct from its milieu.
            </p>
            <p>
               Indeed, it can be said that biological systems are a more sophisticated subset of far-from-equilibrium, 
               self-organizing, dissipative systems. That is to say, life employs internal organizational and functional 
               complexity to achieve intricate, selective, and adaptive means of pursuing, channelling, transforming, 
               and dispersing the sources of matter and energy which must traverse them as a requirement of thermodynamic 
               openness. These distinctive features are closely connected to a particular property of living beings which 
               makes them especially unique as non-equilibrium systems: their persistence is not self-undermining, unlike 
               dissipative systems whose entropy maximization exhausts the energy gradients which create and sustain 
               their structural regularities. <a href="#e">[30]</a> I will return to this point in a later section, after 
               first discussing the idea that there's a directional trajectory to the dynamics of energy transformation 
               and dispersal favoured by the evolutionary development of living systems and their activity.
            </p>
            <p>
               A relatively common theme among many of the authors referenced above is the idea that there is some 
               progressive trajectory 
               implicit in the emergent self-organizing and dissipative properties of non-equilibrium systems. That is to say, 
               many of these thinkers champion the view that life and its various features are inevitable outcomes of a 
               physical reality shaped by thermodynamic principles. This lies in contrast with a cosmological interpretation 
               of entropy which sees life as an  
               improbable and aberrant phenomenon appearing inconsistent with the laws of physical reality. For some, this 
               alternative view motivates theoretical explorations of the relationship between thermodynamics and the origins 
               of rudimentary forms of intelligence, meaning, and/or cognition in living beings. <a href="#e">[31]</a>
               For others, the history of 
               biological complexification also points to a tacit purposiveness in living systems of all scales to develop 
               toward increasingly effective forms of accelerated energy exploiting, transformation and dispersal. 
               It is the latter of such views 
               which I will describe in the following section, connecting it with theoretical frameworks such as Gradient Reduction 
               Theory and the Maximum Entropy Production Principle, and relating these perspectives to ideas regarding 
               planetary-scale energy transformations in the development and functioning of both natural and technological 
               global spheres.

            <p class="subtitle">Entropy and the Directional Trajectory of the Biosphere and Technosphere</p>
            <p>
               Many of the researchers highlighted earlier share an interest in aligning their ideas about the 
               relationship between life and dissipative, nonequilibrium systems with an historical or evolutionary 
               framework of some kind. <a href="#e">[32]</a> Additionally, some seek to explore how such processes 
               might manifest and operate in systems which occupy vast temporal and spatial scales such as ecosystems, 
               civilizations, or the planetary biosphere. In the section that follows, I will provide a few examples 
               of such thinking, each of which adopts a somewhat unique approach to this theme, yet both of whom 
               share a common theoretical foundation in the dissipative properties of far-from-equilibrium 
               thermodynamic systems. I will then highlight the relevance of such thinking for framing the 
               relationship between the Earth system and our modern technological civilization.
            </p>
            <p>
               One expression of this evolutionary, biospheric perspective of non-equilibrium systems is Gradient Reduction Theory 
               [henceforth GRT], proposed by Dorion Sagan and Earth scientist Jessica Hope Whiteside in their contribution to a 
               collection of essays re-examining the conceptual foundations of th Gaia hypothesis. <a href="#e">[33]</a> 
               In this publication, 
               Sagan and Whiteside explore the idea that non-equilibrium thermodynamics connects purely physical flow structures 
               to biological processes and systems of varying degrees of complexity—from prokaryotic metabolism to complex animals, 
               human civilization, and the biosphere, or “Gaia”, itself. Furthermore, these biological systems are thought to be long-evolved 
               manifestations of an inclination belonging to all natural processes on Earth: a tendency in the 
               evolutionary development of far-from-equilibrium systems to accelerate increasingly effective forms of entropy 
               production, or energy transformations and dispersal. <a href="#e">[34]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
               For instance, Sagan and Whiteside propose that the widespread proliferation of humans relative to other species 
               “is in large part due to … a much enhanced ability to identify and deploy the food and other gradients necessary 
               to move agricultural and technical civilization into the material evolutionary form which is humanity.”  
               <a href="#e">[35]</a> They also argue that the thermodynamic imperative to exploit energy potentials points not only 
               to “the process of life’s origination” but also a directionality to life’s development at the planetary scale, in 
               the form of “growth (increase in biomass), reproduction, increase in respiration, energy efficiency, number and 
               types of taxa (biodiversity), rates of circulation of elements, numbers of elements involved in biological 
               circulation, and [an] increase in intelligence.”  <a href="#e">[36]</a> This sentiment is repeated in Sagan’s 2016 
               article <i>Möbius Trip: The Technosphere and Our Science Fiction Reality</i>, wherein he writes of how 
               “life’s entropy-producing systems are completely natural within the cosmic context of the observed tendency of 
               energy to spread. Indeed, life’s ability to identify and delocalize concentrated pockets of energy is arguably 
               its natural reason for being, why it is favored in a thermodynamic universe.” <a href="#e">[37]</a>
               This tendency underpins energy-driven evolutionary “trends ranging from expansion of the area inhabited by life 
               to increase in respiration efficiency ... to increase in sensory modes, increase in information processed, and 
               increase in energy stored, commandeered, and deployed in life’s operations at Earth’s surface.” <a href="#e">[39]</a>
               For Sagan, this suggests “a more-than-human, thermodynamically driven, ecosystemic increase in biodiversity, net 
               intelligence, perceptual and metabolic modes ... over evolutionary time.” <a href="#e">[39]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               We find a related perspective contained in the idea of the Maximum Entropy Production Principle 
               [Henceforth MEPP]. According to 
               this view, non-equilibrium systems will develop toward optimizing for states where the rate of entropy production 
               via energy flux and dissipation is maximized given their environmental constraints. <a href="#e">[40]</a> In 
               addition to this generalized formulation, proponents hold that a variety of non-trivial features in the evolution 
               of life can be traced to this thermodynamic property of open systems. Physicist and mathematician Leonid Martyushev 
               has published extensively on the topic, drawing from the work of mathematical biologist Alfred Lotka, Earth systems 
               scientist Axel Kleidon, ecologist Howard Odum, and others to explore the relevance of the MEPP in describing 
               evolving biological systems. Increases in the complexity and organization of living systems—from microbes to 
               metazoans—are thought to develop in accordance with this common principle, whereby “increasing the metabolic rate 
               in order to maximize the consumption of free energy” drives “organisms [to] gradually become more complex in 
               a natural way.” <a href="#e">[41]</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
               Contemporary advocates of the MEPP such as Kleidon and Odum also view these energy-driven evolutionary dynamics 
               as pivotal to describing the activity of the Earth system more broadly, focusing on energy flow through large 
               complex systems—such as economic systems and ecological networks—that emerge as a result of life’s activity.
               <a href="#e">[42]</a>  In a similar vein, Martyushev holds that the MEPP is “the most important principle 
               explaining the direction (progression) of biological and technological evolution” as it corresponds with “the 
               increase in complexity of living creatures in the course of evolution, the emergence of human beings, and 
               the entire course of the development of our civilization (from humans that started using fire to humans widely 
               using oil fuel and atomic energy).” <a href="#e">[43]</a> The scope of GRT or the MEPP therefore appears 
               inclusive enough to address questions concerning the relationship between thermodynamics and the origin of life, 
               its adaptive historical development, and various scales of its hierarchical organization. At their highest strata 
               of application, these views encourage us to see the development and operation of large-scale biospheric, social, 
               and technological organization in accordance with a natural principle driving the energetic dynamics of 
               non-equilibrium systems.

            <p>
               What we have then, are various researchers working in areas related to physics, chemistry, biology, philosophy, 
               complex systems, and Earth sciences who have developed kindred theoretical frameworks for understanding the production of 
               entropy as an enabling feature of self-organized complexity in the natural world. From this perspective, 
               spatiotemporally ordered systems tend to emerge spontaneously as a means to degrade energy at elevated rates, 
               with their recursive self-organized complexity facilitated by a continuous flux of matter and energy from the 
               environment. Living systems are constituted in a similar manner and have evolved more complex and specific means of 
               locating, exploiting, and dissipating energy in order to produce, maintain, and replicate 
               their organizational identity. Phenomena such as this can therefore be understood as a natural outgrowth of the 
               second law of thermodynamics, underpinning nonequilibrium systems both nonliving and living alike. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This principle of energy dissipation may also be implicated in the growth and adaptive development of increasingly 
               complex living systems and certain products of their activity. This is thought to include evolutionary developments 
               in organismal complexity, ecosystemic biodiversity, social organization, and technological systems, and their total 
               contribution to an expanded rate of energy transformation occurring on this planet. In other words, adopting the 
               aforementioned perspectives on the role of entropy in the generation and development of biological order might 
               allow us to understand the activity of life at multiple levels—including aspects of human civilization such as the 
               technosphere <a href="#e">[44]</a>—in concordance with the conditions of a thermodynamic universe. In a sense, the 
               universal thermodynamic principle of entropy production lies at the heart of a worldview which naturalizes life and its 
               activity, situating it in a quasi-purposeful cosmos directed toward generating increasingly sophisticated 
               dissipative systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
               For the human species, a theory such as this could have a significant impact on how we frame the relationship 
               between our technological civilization and Earth system functioning. Insofar as we can talk about the evolutionary 
               development of human technologies, the pace at which such change occurs is thought to be
               significantly more rapid than that which transpires through the phylogenetic history of biological systems. 
               <a href="#e">[45]</a> This accelerated change in our technological landscape has also been at the center of 
               profound Anthropogenic transformations in multiple planetary spheres, while simultaneously imposing conditions of 
               critical interdependence between our species, the biosphere, and the continued viability of a functioning 
               technosphere. <a href="#e">[46]</a> It's possible that situating the technosphere within the context of a thermodynamic drive toward 
               enhanced rates of energy transformation and dispersal might shed some light on how to ensure the 
               viability of our technological systems by aligning aspects of their development and functioning with at 
               least one crucial, 
               deeply natural feature of planetary life.

               Indeed, some researchers have already made efforts to explore the relationship between planetary technology, 
               thermodynamics, and the Anthropocene, such as Axel Kleidon, who has written about the energetics of the 
               technosphere, “the ultimate thermodynamic imperative to evolve to states of greater energy conversions and 
               higher levels of entropy production at the planetary scale”, and the Earth system’s need for “the technosphere 
               to make this evolutionary step to the next thermodynamic level of greater energy conversions.” 
               <a href="#e">[47]</a> How then might the technosphere complement this “thermodynamic imperative” which biological 
               systems seem to embody so effectively? How might we characterize the technosphere’s ability to dissipate energy, 
               and how does it compare in this regard to living systems? In the final portion of this paper, I speculate about 
               this conceptual relationship between the technosphere and biosphere by turning my focus toward the material 
               constitution of human technological artifacts. The following considerations will be used to guide this inquiry:

            <p style="margin-left: 30px">
               ◾  How does human technology differ from evolved, open, living nonequilibrium systems?
            </p>
            Many of the authors previously cited give us good reason to distinguish strongly between living systems, such as 
            organisms, from existing artifactual systems, such as machines. One significant difference 
            involves a comparison between the processual dynamism of 
            biology, compared to the engineered stability of mechanical artifacts. For instance, Rod Swenson writes of machines being 
            constituted by the static order of fixed and functional components, all of which have been designed by an artificer. In 
            contrast with this, living systems are defined by a self-organized, dynamic order whose identity is 
            self-produced “through the incessant flux of their components, which are continuously being replaced from 
            raw materials in their environments and being expelled in a more dissipated form.” <a href="#e">[48]</a> 
            All extant human artifacts, machines, or 
            other technological devices and systems lack this autokatakinetic property of being realized through 
            continuous, dynamic flows of material and energetic dissipation.
            </p>
            <p>
               This difference has also been described in terms of the transitional and stable identities of biological systems and 
               machines, respectively. Daniel Nicholson writes that while “an organism naturally maintains itself in a state of 
               continuous flux” as a “temporary manifestation of the self-producing organizational unity of the whole”, a machine 
               and its components “remain distinct, stable, and identifiable over time.” <a href="#e">[49]</a> That is to say, living 
               systems are grounded in the thermodynamic principles compel them to “break 
               down the materials they take in from their environment in order to acquire the energy they need to rebuild their 
               constituents … maintain themselves in a steady state far from thermodynamic equilibrium … and dissipate energy and 
               excrete material wastes back into their environment.” <a href="#e">[50]</a> Human technology does not operate 
               like this 
               in any credible sense, its structural or organizational identity is completely unlike the processual dynamism of 
               open dissipative systems described here. <a href="#e">[51]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               Framed alternatively, biological systems are ascribed as having a much greater degree of autonomy than machines. Part 
               of what it means for dynamic living order to be constituted by a flux of energetic and material processes is that 
               thermodynamically open systems of this kind acquire self-organizing and self-constructing properties and functions which contribute to the 
               system’s own determination, maintenance and persistence. In other words, living systems are considered both causes 
               and effects of themselves, capable of promoting the conditions of their own autopoietic existence through 
               thermodynamically-grounded environmental interactions shaping intrinsic energetic and material circulation. <a href="#e">[52]</a>
               By contrast, technological systems are allopoietic or heteropoietic: that is to say, 
               many “have as the product of their functioning something different from themselves,” relying in nearly all 
               respects on human agency, 
               design, and intervention to become organized, perform functionally, and persist and evolve through time. <a href="#e">[53]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               Another salient difference between living and technological systems can be illustrated by their respective energy 
               dissipation rates. Drawing considerably on the work of environmental scientist Vaclav Smil, philosopher Thomas Nail 
               has argued that, despite an exponential rise in human-induced energy expenditure during the last century, the technosphere 
               is still orders of magnitude less effective than the biosphere when it comes to rates of energy expenditure and 
               dissipation, paling in comparison to biodiverse ecosystems such as old-growth forests. <a href="#e">[54]</a> For 
               Nail, both vegetal and animal life are “massive energy-degrading [processes] of radical expenditure and waste,” with 
               plants acting as “powerful dissipative systems that degrade solar energy into low-grade heat energy, water, and oxygen” 
               and animals dissipating 80–90% of the energy they consume as heat. <a href="#e">[55]</a> 
               Schneider and Sagan similarly emphasize the powerful entropy producing features of biodiverse Amazonian 
               rainforests, <a href="#e">[56]</a> which Sagan has differentiated from what he sees as the current 
               technosphere’s “unsustainable rates of entropy production, which tend to be associated with unsustainable 
               exponential growth and the early, passing stage of pioneer monocultures in immature ecosystems.” 
               <a href="#e">[57]</a> In other words, despite an unprecedented era of accelerated, energy-intensive 
               technological development—one which corresponds with the rapid growth of the modern technosphere—our 
               contemporary technological systems appear largely incapable of matching the sustainable, 
               biologically-effective rates of energy transformation and expenditure measured in the highly 
               entropic activity of the biosphere.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-left: 30px">
               ◾  Could modelling our technology on the dialectic of entropy and life be advantageous for the viability of the technosphere?
            </p>
            <p>
               Comparisons between the dissipative properties of the technosphere and the biosphere are especially 
               interesting because they suggest that the kind of entropic destruction resulting from 
               contemporary fossil-fuel civilization is in fact quite different from the more widespread entropy-amplifying processes 
               which have characterized the history of life on Earth. If anything, humans have reduced the planet’s overall  
               energy expenditure by eradicating dissipative biological systems, indirectly replacing them with technological systems of 
               inferior entropy-producing capabilities. Nail’s recent book <i>Theory of the Earth</i> builds on this idea in order to 
               advance an ethics of dissipative energy expenditure which advocates for bringing environmental politics and philosophy into 
               alignment with the thermodynamic principles shaping biospheric energy flow. <a href="#e">[58]</a> 
               I wish to orient my thinking in a similar direction by speculating about aligning human technology with the 
               principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics which shape the identity 
               and activity of biological systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
               As mentioned earlier, the uniquely self-sustaining tendencies of biological dissipative activity would likely be a 
               critical consideration for any effort to contemplate the prospect of modelling technological systems on nonequilibrium 
               thermodynamics as it pertains to the dialectic of entropy and life. To reiterate, the structural order of non-living 
               dissipative systems can only persist in the presence of an energy gradient and ceases as soon as the energy source 
               is depleted. However, the patterns of dynamic regularity which constitute such systems emerge as pathways to amplify 
               the rate at which energy passes through them. This has the consequence of reducing the long-term persistence and 
               propagation of the system’s self-organized identity. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Life, by contrast, extends this dissipative energetic process over much greater timescales, both 
               ontogenetically—over organismal development and life-cycles—and phylogenetically—through reproduction and evolution. 
               In other words, biology is capable of embodying the dynamics shared by open, nonequilibrium, dissipative systems 
               while avoiding the process whereby such activity threatens to undermine the orderliness generated therefrom. 
               While I am unable to provide a detailed account of how this is accomplished, I will quickly share a few examples 
               which touch on how these dynamics might factor into minimal and proto-biological systems, as well as ecological 
               or biospheric processes.
            </p>
            <p>
               Firstly, previous works by Deacon <a href="#e">[59]</a> have sought to develop a theory of 
               “the distinctive modification of thermodynamic processes that characterize the intrinsic end-directed 
               dynamics characteristic of life.” <a href="#e">[60]</a> Referred to as “teleodynamics,” this theoretical approach is 
               intended to highlight the teleological properties of living systems which are otherwise both continuous 
               with, yet simultaneously transcend, the self-eliminating activity of purely physical nonequilibrium 
               systems. Recall Deacon’s autogen, a model for a minimal teleodynamic system. The autogen is a simple 
               molecular cycle consisting of two dissipative self-assembling systems coupled synergistically such 
               that each supplies a boundary condition for the other’s activity. These mutually limiting, reciprocal 
               constraints endow the emergent macrosystem with a primitive means of regulating otherwise self-terminating 
               nonequilibrium thermodynamic processes, while enabling the global system to approximate end-directedness 
               as a result of its ability to maintain historical continuity over generations of replication and repair.
            </p>
            <p>
               Zooming out to a planetary scale, we might turn our attention back to the dynamics of one of life’s maximally 
               dissipative extant systems—the collective activity of photosynthetic organisms. Forest ecosystems, for 
               example, are enormously dissipative although their transformation of solar energy crucially involves 
               generating oxygen as a molecular waste product. Indeed, all photosynthetic life-forms, especially 
               marine microorganisms, partake in this biospheric process of energy transduction and dispersal critical 
               to sustaining the expansive diversity of aerobic life on Earth. Moreover, plants in particular play a 
               role in global evapotranspiration, helping to regulate surface and air temperatures through feedback loops 
               between warming environments and cooling mechanisms, involving the release of excess evaporated water 
               and the resultant creation of cloud cover. <a href="#e">[61]</a> As put forward by ecologist James 
               Lovelock and evolutionary biologist Lynn Margulis, there is reason to believe the Earth has maintained 
               a relatively metastable state of atmospheric homeostasis for hundreds of millions of years as a 
               result of complex regulatory feedback processes facilitated, more generally, by the living biosphere. <a href="#e">[62]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               With these examples in mind, it could be said that to some degree living dissipative systems owe their 
               emergence and persistence to relational, regulative, and regenerative dynamics which they both embody 
               internally and enact reciprocally with other dissipative systems. For example, a crucial ingredient in 
               the emergence and perseverance of autopoietic systems is the intrinsic, mutually-regulating boundary 
               conditions, and subsequently evolved organizational constraints, of various holistically interrelated 
               thermodynamic processes—allowing the system to harness flows of energy and matter and effectively 
               generate entropy without compromising its identity. <a href="#e">[63]</a> Furthermore, the far-from-equilibrium energetic 
               landscape of the biosphere sustains dissipative activity through multi-metabolic processes which 
               involve recycling waste products and exporting entropy as heat away from its surfaces and into outer 
               space. <a href="#e">[64]</a> That is to say, life enables augmented entropy production through adaptive and 
               self-regulatory activity, circumventing the self-eliminating properties of non-living dissipative 
               systems while becoming ecologically integrated with other living systems. These properties seem 
               especially well suited to facilitating elevated rates of long term, biologically-effective energy 
               dispersal without undermining biospheric viability. <a href="#e">[65]</a> It might be interesting then to consider the 
               idea of assimilating such properties into the constitution and operations of technological systems 
               as a means to ensure the viability of an “energetically prodigious and sustainable” <a href="#e">[66]</a> 
               planetary technosphere.
            </p>
            <p>
               Orienting ourselves toward this possibility of a technosphere embodying far-from-equilibrium, continuously 
               self-organizing, dissipative properties might reframe our relationship with technological systems is 
               a similar way to how theories 
               regarding the thermodynamics of self-organization and biological order reframed life as a natural and expected 
               feature of the cosmos. That is to say, it may give us reason to see the potential for technology to become more like the 
               complex and ordered natural systems which appear to spontaneously emerge from, and thrive in, a thermodynamic universe. At the very 
               least, it may motivate us to imagine how we might engineer the technosphere and its artificial components 
               to be more reciprocally connected with the ubiquitous material and energy flows shaping bio-terrestrial expenditure. In 
               both cases, human technology could be guided toward a paradigm where it operates in harmony with, and not distinct from 
               or hostile to, living systems. At the core of this transformation, should it happen to be feasible, 
               would be an objective to approximate or reproduce with our technological systems the activity and associated 
               dissipative properties of open, non-equilibrium, biological systems.

            <p>
               This question is a highly speculative prompt, to be sure, and should be considered as no more than a loosely 
               sketched thought experiment. 
               I do not purport to offer any precise or concrete proposals for how one might go about developing living technology with 
               thermodynamic properties that correspond to those exhibited by biological systems. Instead, I wish to 
               provide only a general outline of this hypothetical technological future by pointing to a few 
               promising developments in bioengineering and synthetic biology, briefly touching on why these advances warrant further 
               attention in the context of our exploration of the dialectical relationship between entropy and open nonequilibrium systems. 
            </p>
            <p>
               One area of interest which may prove to be relevant to this conceptual endeavour is synthetic morphology. This emerging 
               sub-discipline of synthetic biology began to take shape around 2008, when developmental biologist Jamie Davies published 
               a paper outlining the prospects of engineering “self-constructing assemblies of cells.” <a href="#e">[67]</a>  
               Practitioners in this nascent field are generally interested in understanding the rules of morphogenesis and their 
               application in the construction of devices using, or entirely comprised of, engineered living tissues. <a href="#e">[68]</a> 
               In other words, these researchers are interested in how living matter self-organizes, studying the unique properties of 
               individual cells and the collective behaviour they exhibit when assembling into various pluricellular configurations 
               and using that knowledge to develop new hybrid living-technological systems. <a href="#e">[69]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               While thermodynamics does not currently play much of a role in this work, for our purposes, developments in synthetic 
               morphology point toward a horizon where technological systems are brought into even closer proximity with living 
               systems—not merely in an attempt to emulate biology, as is often the case in areas of biomimetic design, but by 
               comprehensively devising novel engineered systems composed of living matter itself. Learning to 
               design technological systems using “agential materials” <a href="#e">[70]</a> may require engineering considerations of  
               the material, energetic and organizational properties of living nonequilibrium systems and the characteristics of  
               such systems which are instrumentally relevant to synthetic morphology—e.g., autopoietic and teleological causality, 
               self-organization, adaptivity and agency. <a href="#e">[71]</a> Efforts 
               in this field might also chart a path toward the symbiotic integration of a new class of biological artifacts into 
               the broader dissipative flows that characterize the thermodynamic activity of organisms and ecologies.
            </p>
            <p>
               This nascent field complements similar aims in other areas of synthetic biology, reflecting a general disposition 
               toward engineering technological systems using biological and/or biochemical components and processes. 
               These include applications in cellular 
               agriculture and other bioeconomic platforms, <a href="#e">[72]</a> experiments in the design and construction of built 
               environments grown using engineered living material, <a href="#e">[73]</a> as well as various efforts to transform 
               industrial processes involved in chemical, pharmaceutical, and material manufacturing, energy and fuel production, and 
               waste remediation via the deployment of metabolically engineered molecular systems. <a href="#e">[74]</a> 
               Similarly, advances in biological computing point toward a potential future where 
               emerging technological systems may hold the promise of operating more congruously with living dynamics 
               as a result of biological embodiment. 
               Notable examples include the development of microprocessors powered by photosynthetic 
               algae, <a href="#e">[75]</a> and early research into the use of stem cell-derived 
               neural organoids in biological computing. <a href="#e">[76]</a>
            </p>
            <p>
               Once more, although thermodynamics does not yet appear to be central to these 
               advances in synthetic biology, the general impetus to explore the frontiers of engineered systems comprised of biological 
               matter may be a desired direction in the path toward living technology with embodied dissipative and metabolic properties. 
               <a href="#e">[77]</a> It may indeed be one of the first steps toward the construction of a technosphere which can begin to 
               match the amplified entropy-producing capabilities of organisms and ecosystems, while reflecting 
               life's ability to sustain dissipative activity without compromising its own existence. 
               As researchers like Nail have indicated, 
               a significant fraction of the planet’s most effective dissipative systems (living ecosystems) have been, 
               and continue to be, decimated as the result of 
               the accelerated technological and economic growth associated with the Anthropocene, lowering the 
               planet’s total rate of entropic expenditure. <a href="#e">[78]</a> Relying on the affordances of our contemporary 
               technosphere alone may be insufficient to compensate for this loss, as its dissipative properties appear to be both 
               orders of magnitude less effective than the terrestrial biosphere’s and its growth, self-maintenance, and stability 
               are far from guaranteed. <a href="#e">[79]</a> Earth’s biological systems may be incapable of evolving rapidly 
               enough to respond to this change, as well, further deferring the emergence of novel entropy producing systems 
               on a planetary scale. So, along with the many practical and imperative measures required to address various, 
               profound transformations engendered by the Anthropocene, working towards the development of bio-engineered 
               artifacts embodying the dissipative properties of living nonequilibrium systems could be a fruitful avenue 
               towards post-Anthropocene terraforming in service of restoring and ideally augmenting a sustainable 
               thermodynamic imperative for energy to spread—however abstract or imaginative this may seem at present.

            <p class="subtitle">Conclusion</p>
            <p>
               In surveying a literature on the notion of entropy and its role in enabling the generation of self-organized complexity 
               in open nonequilibrium systems, a throughline can be traced from non-living physical systems to forms of biological 
               organization and activity at multiple scales—from individual autopoietic cells to planetary systems. The view that the 
               conditions of a thermodynamic universe provide an impetus for the emergence and development of increasingly sophisticated 
               vehicles for amplifying 
               planetary rates of energy dispersal provides a conceptual paradigm for thinking about connections and divergences between two 
               global energetic systems: the biosphere and the technosphere. Drawing on theoretical biology and recent 
               developments in bioengineering, we might aspire to imagine a future technosphere comprised of technological 
               systems whose material, energetic and organizational properties are more closely aligned with the 
               nonequilibrium thermodynamics which permeate naturally ordered systems and the self-sustaining activity and 
               constitution of life.

                  referred to Lord Kelvin’s work in identifying the conditions for a universe threatened with “eternal death” or “condemned

               <text class="enclr">It may be worth noting that Sagan and Whiteside technically do not subscribe to the notion that entropy is being 
                  explicitly maximized by the behaviour of gradient-degrading thermodynamic systems, preferring to focus the reader’s
                  attention on the energy flows alone which organize such systems. In their thinking, GRT is a restating of the second 
                  law of thermodynamics, albeit one which emphasizes energy potentials and flow through complex systems over universal 
                  net entropy production. Despite this, their explanation of the general mechanics of their subject of interest remains 
                  relatively similar to most thinkers in this area and the difference they highlight does not seem considerable enough 
                  to put them appreciably at odds with others interested in the directed development of complex systems driven by 
                  thermodynamic principles. Indeed, in more recent work, Sagan uses the terms gradient reduction and entropy production 
                  interchangeably, suggesting that while the latter may not be maximized it is nonetheless thought to be amplified by 
                  living dissipative systems.

                  the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, or the biosphere. Put briefly, it is a global interconnected system of technological 
                  artifacts, social structures, and physical infrastructure which constitute the totality of the built human environment, the 
                  particular energy and resource transformations underpinning the system’s metabolic profile, and the emergent principles that

               underdeveloped point and the antecedent paragraphs which only begin to expand upon it. 
               Relatedly, it should also be noted that biospheric dissipative activity has been operating 
               in a relatively self-sustaining manner for billions of years, in contrast with only a few 
               hundred years of entropy production generated by a modern technosphere that is currently 
               straining the limits of planetary viability.
