     Hierarchical Transitions and the Rules of the Technosphere
  </div>
  <div class="p">
     Last year I had an opportunity to attend an Environmental Humanities graduate seminar at the University of British Columbia with the 
        brilliant <a href="https://mcmaster.academia.edu/DerekWoods">Derek Woods</a>. Due to a full course load I was unable to register, 
        but Derek invited me to sit in during any session I’d like, if I found the material interesting and relevant to my research. The 
        topic for the class I dropped in on was “Planetary Technics.” During the seminar discussions I started contemplating some hazy 
        connections between certain themes in a paper we’d read about large-scale technological systems (which I’ll introduce in the 
        following section) and some ideas in theoretical biology about the dynamics of collective interaction and major hierarchic 
        transitions. The following text is an attempt to flesh out these conceptual relationships in some more detail. 
     <p>
     This piece is a work in progress. Initially, I’d only intended to engage with two resources, one text and one lecture, putting them in 
        dialogue with one another to tease out their resemblances and chart future research directions. Naturally, as I was writing I continued 
        to encounter new references that complemented this project and new texts, ideas, and thinkers began to orbit around my efforts. I’ve 
        done my best to integrate some of these new resources into the text, but it’s definitely far from complete. My hope is that I’ll 
        continue developing this line of thought long after these texts have been shared with you here, especially as it has become increasingly 
        apparent to me that this topic is much richer than I’d first imagined. Anyways, let me kick things off. 
     <p style="font-size: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-bottom: 1.5px solid black">Introducing the Technosphere</b>
     <p>
     For Derek’s seminar that week, the required readings touched on a range of topics related primarily to technology, media, geology, ecology, 
        capitalism, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere">noosphere</a>. Among these publications was 
        <a href="https://cee.duke.edu/faculty/peter-haff">Peter Haff</a>‘s <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2053019614530575">Humans 
        and Technology in the Anthropocene: Six Rules</a>, a fascinating paper on the quasi-autonomous dynamics of planetary-scale technological systems. 
        In the text, Haff attempts to encapsulate said dynamics using the following six rules:
     <p>
     <p style="margin-left: 30px"> 
        ① The rule of inaccessibility 
     <br>
        ② The rule of impotence 
     <br>
        ③ The rule of control 
     <br> 
        ④ The rule of reciprocity 
     <br> 
        ⑤ The rule of performance 
     <br>
        ⑥ The rule of provision 
     </p>
     <p>
     Each of these rules express an important feature of large-scale technological systems which defines how humans are compelled to operate in 
        relation to them. While there are many ways of conceiving of something as general as “large-scale technological systems”, Haff’s specific 
        subject of interest here is what he calls the <i>technosphere</i>. Let me start off by quickly describing what exactly this means so I can set 
        the stage for the connections I’m interested in exploring between his work and the idea of hierarchic transitions in biology.
